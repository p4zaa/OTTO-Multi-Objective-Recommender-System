# OTTO Multi-Objective Recommender System
A Kaggle competition | Build a recommender system based on real-world e-commerce sessions.

**Keywords:** `Recommender System` `Graph Neural Network` `Heterogeneous Graph` <br/>
**Tools/Frameworks:** `Python` `Pandas` `Polars` `PyTorch` `PyTorch Geometric` <br/>
**Dataset:** [OTTO â€“ Multi-Objective Recommender System](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/otto-recommender-system/overview)

## Goal of the Competition
The goal of this competition is to predict e-commerce clicks, cart additions, and orders. You'll build a multi-objective recommender system based on previous events in a user session.

Your work will help improve the shopping experience for everyone involved. Customers will receive more tailored recommendations while online retailers may increase their sales.

# Link Prediction with Multi-Objective Recommender System
In this project, I participated in the OTTO Kaggle competition to develop a Multi-Objective Recommender System using a Link Prediction Approach. The dataset used in the competition consisted of 12 million real-world user sessions, 220 million events, and 1.8 million unique articles in the catalog.

I took the initiative to study and work on this project independently, which allowed me to expand my knowledge and skills in the field of machine learning and data processing. I utilized the PyTorch framework and the PyTorch Geometric library to implement Graph Neural Networks. Furthermore, I optimized the code and model to run efficiently on a CUDA GPU and used Polars as the DataFrame library for maximum GPU and memory efficiency.

The main objective of the competition was to build a multi-objective link prediction on a large-scale e-commerce heterogeneous graph. I utilized graph neural networks and link prediction techniques to recommend the most relevant articles to users based on their preferences and past behaviors.
